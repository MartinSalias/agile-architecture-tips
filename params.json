One of the main goals of this website is to provide more detailed descriptions which can be linked from the book, but can also be updated as things evolve.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Techniques\r\n\r\nAfter the book reach its final stage (at least for a given edition), new ideas and techniques will surely come to mind and become important, so this website will provide extensions to the book chapters with some of these features.\r\n\r\n### Open Debate\r\n\r\nThe final goal of this website is to provide space for feedback and discussion about the book, also linked to specific sections and chapters.",
